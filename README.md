# Link Sharing App

This project is a link-sharing app like LinkTree and Beacons. You can create your own profile here with custom links to whatever you want and share it with others.

You can access the deployed application here: https://nicolasgandrade.github.io/link-sharing-app/

This is the API I built for this project, it was made in NodeJS with Express: https://github.com/nicolasgandrade/api-link-sharing

## Development server

Before running the client, make sure you've already setted up the server (https://github.com/nicolasgandrade/api-link-sharing) and an Auth0 project. After setting everything up, update the `environment.ts` file with your custom values, otherwise, the app won't work.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
