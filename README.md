# Link Sharing App

This project is a link-sharing app like LinkTree and Beacons. You can create your own profile here with custom links to whatever you want and share it with others.

You can access the deployed application here: https://nicolasgandrade.github.io/link-sharing-app/

This is the API I built for this project, it was made in NodeJS with Express: https://github.com/nicolasgandrade/api-link-sharing
